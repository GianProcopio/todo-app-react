# To Do App done with React.js

Â¡Hi, this is my 1st project done with React.js!

## Where I learnt React

In this project I learnt the principles of React. I study in Platzi and this project was part of a course ("Introduction to React.js") for beginners.

## What I learnt and what I used

I used React Hooks (useState and useEffect), learned about components and elements, their props and attributes, conditional styling, etc.

## Environment

For this project I used Vite (a tool to develope and compile my production code) and I deployed it with Github Pages.

## Deploy
